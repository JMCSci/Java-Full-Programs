# Bank Managment System

This is my first personal project after one semester of learning to program in Java.

This project was created during the Summer of 2019 and models the services provided by a typical commercial bank. This program utilizes an object oriented design approach and tracks checking accounts, savings accounts, interest rates and all associated personal identification numbers.

The Bank Management System is fully intergrated with a local relational database (MySQL) or online via AWS.
