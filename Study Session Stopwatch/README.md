## Study Session Stopwatch

- JavaFX program allows user to keep track of study sessions 
- Study times (and dates) are recorded to a file when the user clicks the "Stop" button
- Saved filed is named "Study Sessions"

I created this program because MacOS doesn't include a stopwatch out of the box. 
I use this program to keep track of my study sessions.
