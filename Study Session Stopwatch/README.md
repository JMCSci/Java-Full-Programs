# Study Session Stopwatch

- JavaFX program allows user to keep track of study sessions
- Study times (and dates) are saved to a file when the user clicks the "Stop" button or quits the program
- Data saved to file named "Study Sessions"
- Program includes an option for Light or Dark mode (great for late night study sessions)

I created this program because MacOS doesn't include a stopwatch as part of its operating system.
I use this program to keep track of my study sessions.
